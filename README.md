  This API is a hands-on endeavor aimed at building a robust Authentication API for personal learning and skill development. Embracing Clean Architecture, SOLID principles, Test-Driven Development (TDD), TypeScript, Node.js, and MongoDB, this project offers an opportunity to delve into advanced software engineering concepts while creating a secure authentication system. Hope you find it useful!
